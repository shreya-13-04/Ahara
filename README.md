# Ahara - Food Redistribution & Waste Reduction Platform

A **role-aware mobile application** designed to safely redistribute surplus food from **restaurants, events, and institutional kitchens** to **NGOs and community kitchens**.

The platform focuses on **reducing food waste**, **ensuring public health**, and **maintaining accountability** through secure access control, intelligent coordination, and scalable backend services.

---

## Key Objectives
- Reduce edible food waste  
- Ensure safe and timely food redistribution  
- Enable transparent accountability among stakeholders  
- Optimize logistics using intelligent matching  
- Measure social and environmental impact  

---

## Tech Stack

### Mobile Application
- **Flutter** – Cross-platform framework enabling a single codebase for Android and iOS with near-native performance.  
- **Dart** – Strongly typed language optimized for reactive UI and asynchronous operations.  
- **Provider** – Lightweight state management for handling authentication, roles, and global app data.  
- **GoRouter** – Declarative routing for structured and role-based navigation.  
- **Dio** – Advanced HTTP client for secure API communication with interceptors and error handling.

---

### Backend
- **Node.js** – Event-driven runtime supporting scalable and concurrent API handling.  
- **Express.js** – Minimal framework for building structured REST APIs with clear separation of routes and middleware.  
- **Firebase Authentication** – Secure identity management with token-based authentication.

---

### Database
- **MongoDB Atlas** – Cloud-hosted NoSQL database suitable for flexible schemas such as multi-role users, food listings, and audit records.  
- **Mongoose** – ODM for schema validation and simplified database interaction.

---

### Security & Access Control
- **Firebase ID Tokens (JWT)** – Secure API access and session validation.  

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- Food Provider (Donor)  
- NGO  
- Volunteer  
- Admin

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration (CI)
**Tool:** Jenkins  

The project uses a Jenkins-driven CI pipeline to automate development workflows and maintain code reliability.

Triggered automatically on every Pull Request and code merge:

- Static code quality analysis  
- Automated backend test execution  
- Build verification  
- Dependency validation  
- Early failure detection to prevent unstable releases  

---

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

Jenkins pipelines are configured to support controlled deployment workflows, ensuring that only validated builds progress toward production environments.

Key capabilities include:

- Automated build generation  
- Environment-based deployment readiness  
- Scalable pipeline architecture  
- Reduced manual intervention  

---

### Continuous Deployment
- **Backend Deployment:** Render / Railway  
- **Database Hosting:** MongoDB Atlas  
- **Mobile Distribution (Optional):** Firebase App Distribution  

---

## Cloud Infrastructure
- Managed cloud services minimize operational overhead while supporting scalability.  
- Environment variables used for secure secrets management.  
- Stateless API architecture enables horizontal scaling.  

---

## Development Tools
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaborative development  
- **Postman** – API testing and debugging  
- **Docker (Optional)** – Containerized local setup  
- **GitHub Actions** – Automated workflows  

---

## Documentation
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)  
- Architecture Diagram  
- ER Diagram  
- API Documentation  
- Manual Test Case Reports  

---

## Impact
- Reduces large-scale food wastage  
- Supports food-insecure communities  
- Helps lower CO₂ emissions through redistribution  
- Encourages sustainable and responsible consumption  

---

## Team
Built by a cross-functional engineering team focusing on **trust, logistics optimization, real-time coordination, and sustainability-driven system design**.
